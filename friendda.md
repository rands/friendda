# The FriendDA

**WHEREAS** I possess a bright idea that I am choosing to disclose to you, The
Advisor, with the mutual understanding that you are my friend and that you will
not screw me;

**WHEREAS** I believe The Idea will only improve as a result of having solicited
your honest and candid feedback;

**WHEREAS** manners of screwing include, but are not limited to:

- Adapting some or all of The Idea for your own purposes unless I say you can,
- Choosing to share some or all of The Idea with those who are not bound to this
agreement, and
- Failing to do your best to protect The Idea;

**WHEREAS** by requesting your consent to this agreement, I am helping myself
sleep at night by placing a small amount of formality on the sharing of The
Idea;

We, therefore, enter into an agreement ("the FriendDA") on this _____ day of
_______________ 20____ by and between ___________________________ (hereinafter
"you", or "The Advisor") and ___________________________ (hereinafter "The
Keeper of the Idea", "me", or "I") regarding information (hereinafter "The

by sharing The Idea without my consent.

## Term of Agreement

This agreement remains in effect until I or someone I authorize makes The Idea
public.

## Consequences of Breach

This agreement may possibly have some amount of legal binding. However, it is
likely that upon breach or violation of the agreement, I will do no more than
any of the following:

1. Curse you under my breath.
2. Publicly disclose the manner of your screw-i-tude.
3. Write about your transgressions in ALL CAPS.
4. No longer consider you a person with whom I can share my ideas.

## Conditions of Sharing

Sharing of some or all of The Idea with third parties may occur provided that
you have cleared this with me and the third parties agree to the principles of
the FriendDA.

## Termination

Termination of this FriendDA can be executed by either party, but don't be a
douche. You are acknowledging and agreeing to this disclosure by reading it. If
you find any part of this agreement uncomfortable or confusing, don't sweat it.
We'll talk about something else.
