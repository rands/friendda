        <p>
            <strong>WHEREAS</strong> I possess a bright idea that I am choosing to disclose to you, The Advisor, with
            the mutual understanding that you are my friend and that you will not screw me;
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>WHEREAS</strong> I believe The Idea will only improve as a result of having solicited your honest
            and candid feedback;
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>WHEREAS</strong> manners of screwing include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Adapting some or all of The Idea for your own purposes unless I say you can,</li>
            <li>Choosing to share some or all of The Idea with those who are not bound to this agreement, and</li>
            <li>Failing to do your best to protect The Idea;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>WHEREAS</strong> by requesting your consent to this agreement, I am helping myself sleep at night by
            placing a small amount of formality on the sharing of The Idea;
        </p>
        <p>
            We, therefore, enter into an agreement (&quot;the FriendDA&quot;) on this _____ day of _______________
            20____ by and between ___________________________ (hereinafter &quot;you&quot;, or &quot;The Advisor&quot;)
            and ___________________________ (hereinafter &quot;The Keeper of the Idea&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, or
            &quot;I&quot;) regarding information (hereinafter &quot;The Idea&quot;) that I am choosing to share with you
            in which you agree to not screw me by sharing The Idea without my consent.
        </p>

        <h1>
            <strong>Term of Agreement</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>This agreement remains in effect until I or someone I authorize makes The Idea public.</p>
        <h1>
            <strong>Consequences of Breach</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>
            This agreement may possibly have some amount of legal binding. However, it is likely that upon breach or
            violation of the agreement, I will do no more than any of the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Curse you under my breath. </li>
            <li>Publicly disclose the manner of your screw-i-tude.</li>
            <li>Write about your transgressions in ALL CAPS. </li>
            <li>No longer consider you a person with whom I can share my ideas.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>
            <strong>Conditions of Sharing</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>
            Sharing of some or all of The Idea with third parties may occur provided that you have cleared this with me
            and the third parties agree to the principles of the FriendDA.
        </p>

        <h1>
            <strong>Termination</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>
            Termination of this FriendDA can be executed by either party, but don't be a douche. You are acknowledging
            and agreeing to this disclosure by reading it. If you find any part of this agreement uncomfortable or
            confusing, don't sweat it. We'll talk about something else.
